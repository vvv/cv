## Work

### October 2020â€“now: Rust programmer at Elastio

Elastio is a startup building a **cloud-native** backup and recovery solution for public clouds.

What I did there:

- Programmed gRPC API services in Rust (users, email delivery, AWS Lambda invocation, asset filters, _&c._)
- Improved maintainability of the CI (applied `github-actions-dhall`)
- Implemented a config crate (Ã  la `aws config`)
- Enhanced the ergonomics of `elastio` CLI tool
- Wrote ransomware detection tools â€” from early experiments and prototypes to the alpha version

Technologies:
- Rust: `nom`, `sqlx`, `tokio`, `tonic`
- AWS: EBS, EC2, ECR, Lambda, S3
- Protobuf
- Docker
- Bash, `jq`, Python

### 2011â€“2020: Distributed object store

Company: Xyratex â†’ Seagate

The project started as an exascale **object storage system** for HPC.  Then it pivoted into an archival solution.  Then a hybrid cloud...  The code had been [open-sourced][cortx-motr] in autumn 2020.

#### May 2017â€“June 2019: Haskell programmer, team lead

* Inherited a **High Availability** (HA) solution â€” 50K lines of Haskell code â€” from [Tweag.io][] developers.  Coped with it. :sweat_smile:
* **Mentored** 5 colleagues, who never programmed Haskell before.  We had become a team of Haskell developers.
* Maintenance.  New features development.
