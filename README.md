## Work experience

### 2011–2020: Distributed object store

:earth_asia: _Remote work, globally distributed team._

**Company:** Xyratex → Seagate

R&D project.  Initially targeting exascale HPC, then archive solution, now — hybrid cloud.  To be open-sourced in autumn 2020.

##### July 2019–August 2020: "Hare" project :rabbit:

Our team of 5 had successfully replaced the legacy HA system with a simpler solution based on Consul.

My main contributions:
* [Collaboration model](http://hintjens.com/blog:23) à la ZeroMQ — the team became a happy oasis :palm_tree: set amid enterprise desolation.
* RFCs — I've established and promoted the systematic way of writing technical specifications.
* Tests automation (CI), merge bot ("Not Rocket Science Rule of Software Engineering").

Technologies:
- Dhall :fountain_pen:, bash, Python
- Consul
- GitLab CI, Jenkins

##### May 2017–June 2019: HA system maintainer, team lead

* Inherited a high availability (HA) solution — 50K lines of Haskell code — from Tweag.io developers.
* Coped with it. :sunglasses:
* Trained a team of 5 engineers, who had no prior Haskell experience.

##### June 2011–May 2017: C programmer

* Configuration cache subsystem (DAG of conf objects, client/server, graph traversal APIs, data format converter, visualization) — design and implementation.
* Modular initialization/finalization mechanism — implementation.
* Memory-efficient representation of device pools — design and implementation.
* Wrote helper scripts that improved developer experience.

Technologies: C, Python, bash, a sprinkle of Expect and JavaScript.

### January 2011–May 2011: Embedded software engineer

**Company:** Cogent Plus

* Integrated third-party TR-069 client with [OpenRG](https://web.archive.org/web/20110515113200/http://www.jungo.com/openrg/pr_openrg.html) middleware (Linux-based).  The software ran on ITS Telecom mobile broadband router.

### 2006–2010: Mobile operator data processing

**Company:** UMC → MTC → Vodafone

Pipeline: telecom equipment → CDRs → my software :wave: → Oracle DB

Technologies: C++, Python, PL/SQL, m4 (mon petit DSL for Zwiki tables).

Pet projects:
* [under.c](https://github.com/vvv/under.c)
* [topla](https://github.com/vvv/topla)

### 1999–2006: Nuclear power plant simulators

**Company:** ИТЦ ПК (GSE Systems' subcontractor)

"Plant process" graphical dashboard application ([behold :desktop_computer:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_WoXBLTCLs&t=51s)).  I ported it from IRIX to Linux, adapted to the needs of our project and integrated.

Technologies:
- SysV IPC (shmem, sockets), dbm, X11, CGI
- C, C++, bash, awk, Python
- gtkmm, ACE framework, Trac (issues & wiki), [DataViews](https://www.prs.de/dataviews%E2%84%A2)

## :mortar_board: Education

* 1993: Kyiv Natural Science Lyceum No. 145
  Award of recognition for outstanding grades in math.

* 1999: National Technical University of Ukraine "Kyiv Polytechnic Institute"
  Avionics engineer, diploma with honours.

## Community

* [LtU-Kyiv hackathon](https://wiki.haskell.org/LtU-Kiev/Hackathon) — organizer
* 2015: DroidPlanner app (Android) — volunteer, accidental team leader
* Haskell study group
* Elm study group
* [Rust Hack & Learn, Kyiv](https://kyivlambda.com/rust-hack-and-learn/README_en) — organizer
