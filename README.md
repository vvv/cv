### 2011â€“2020: Distributed object store

Company: Xyratex â†’ Seagate

The project started as an exascale **object storage system** for HPC.  Then it pivoted into an archival solution.  Then a hybrid cloud...  The code had been [open-sourced][cortx-motr] in autumn 2020.

#### July 2019â€“August 2020: "Hare" team leader :rabbit:

I lead a team of 5 engineers.  We had successfully replaced legacy HA (High Availability) system with a simpler solution based on **Consul**.

My contributions:
* [PC3][] collaboration model â€” for 5 months the team was a happy oasis :palm_tree: set amid enterprise desolation
* Introducing the practice of **[RFCs][]**
* Tests automation, CI, merge bot
* [Configuration][`cfgen`] module

Technologies: Python, **Dhall** ðŸ–‹, Bash; Consul; GitLab CI, Jenkins; GFM-formatted English

#### May 2017â€“June 2019: Haskell programmer, team leader

* Inherited a **High Availability** (HA) solution â€” 50K lines of Haskell code â€” from [Tweag.io][] developers.  Coped with it. :sweat_smile:
* **Mentored** 5 colleagues, who never programmed in Haskell before.  In a few months we became a _functional_ team, doing maintenance work and developing new features.

Technologies: **Cloud Haskell**, `Control.Monad.Operational`

#### June 2011â€“May 2017: C programmer

* [Configuration caching][confc] subsystem (DAG of conf objects, client/server, graph traversal APIs, data format converter, visualization) â€” design and implementation
* Modular initialization/finalization mechanism â€” implementation
* Memory-efficient representation of device pools â€” design and implementation
* Wrote helper scripts that were well received by colleagues

Technologies: C, Python, Bash, a sprinkle of **Expect**
